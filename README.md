# engineering-analysis-project
This is a group collaboration for a break-even cost analysis estimation project in Matlab.
I coded up pretty much 100% of the project

We were tasked as engineers of an engineering firm hired to design and analyze the construction of new zoo enclosures. 
Our primary objective was to conduct a break-even cost analysis to submit for the project.
